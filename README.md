## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [BEM methodology](https://en.bem.info/methodology/)
- [Sass/scss](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [ViteJs](https://vitejs.dev/)

### What I learned

First ever project where i have used the BEM methodology, definitely helped me organise my code structure better and saved some time naming HTML class names.  

Used Sass/Scss partial to make the site easy to maintain in the near future. Love Sass!


### Continued development

In future projects I'd like to work on my time management skills to boost my efficency and productivity.

Write organized clean codes that are easy to maintain and are reusable.
